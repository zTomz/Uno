# Uno Card Game Rules

Uno is a classic card game that is easy to learn and provides hours of entertainment. The Uno Card Game App follows the traditional Uno rules with a few customizable options. Here's a quick guide on how to play:

## Objective

The main objective of Uno is to be the first player to score 500 points. Points are scored by playing cards strategically and being the first to empty your hand.

## Setup

1. **Deck:** Uno is played with a deck of 108 cards, consisting of four colors: red, yellow, green, and blue. Each color has cards numbered from 0 to 9, along with special action cards.

2. **Special Cards:**
   - Skip: Skips the next player's turn.
   - Reverse: Reverses the direction of play.
   - Draw Two: Forces the next player to draw two cards.
   - Draw Four: Forces the next player to draw four cards.

3. **Dealing:** Each player is dealt 7 cards. The remaining cards form the draw pile, with the top card placed face-up next to it to start the discard pile.

## Gameplay

1. **Starting the Game:** The player to the dealer's left goes first. Play moves clockwise.

2. **Matching Cards:** Players must match the top card of the discard pile either by number, color, or symbol.

3. **Special Actions:**
   - Skip: The next player in the turn order is skipped.
   - Reverse: Reverses the direction of play.
   - Draw Two: The next player must draw two cards and forfeit their turn.

4. **Wild Cards:**
   - Wild: The player can choose the next color.
   - Wild Draw Four: The player can choose the next color, and the next player must draw four cards and forfeit their turn.

5. **Going Out:** When a player has one card left, they must say "Uno." Failure to do so and get caught by another player results in drawing two cards.

6. **Winning a Round:** The first player to play all their cards scores points based on the remaining cards in opponents' hands. The game continues until a player reaches 500 points.
